summary: |
  Agile Technical Coach helping teams in adopting the necessary technical practices to deliver higher quality products at a higher speed and at lower costs.

  I like to help teams in creating meaningful software, with a keen eye for code quality and software delivery process - from customer interaction to continuous delivery. Instead of balancing quality & delivery, I believe and practice that better quality is actually a way to more and better deliveries. High speed, high quality.

  Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery consultant.

  Software craftsman.

  Occasional speaker at conferences.

  Always searching for the simple solution that fits in my head.

  It is a deliberate choice to be a generalist, because more experiences results in more creativity.
