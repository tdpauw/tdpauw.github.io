summary: |
  Agile Technical Coach helping teams in adopting the necessary technical practices to deliver higher quality products at a higher speed and at lower costs.

  I like to help teams in creating meaningful software, with a keen eye for code quality and software delivery process - from customer interaction to continuous delivery. Instead of balancing quality & delivery, I believe and practice that better quality is actually a way to more and better deliveries. High speed, high quality.

  Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery consultant.

  Software craftsman.

  Occasional speaker at conferences.

  Always searching for the simple solution that fits in my head.

  It is a deliberate choice to be a generalist, because more experiences results in more creativity.

      Improved the software delivery flow and reduce the lead time of the software delivery process by:

      * improving the Kanban system by introducing WIP limits
      * reducing story sizing and improving estimates
      * enforce the pull mechanism of Kanban
      * improving the overall software design towards an Hexagonal architecture which improves the decoupling of the software code

      OASIS project: Operations and Support Intelligence System

      The goal of the project was to set up an enterprise wide monitoring platform to monitor SWIFT's core applications that run the messaging trafic and to centralise all application logs.
      It was run using Lean Startup principles: define a hypothesis, try something out and see if the hypothesis is validated. As a result we pivoted a lot based on the information we received from internal customers.
      The project consisted of a core team of 4 people and an extended virtual team of volunteers coming from different departments.

      My contribution to the project consisted of:

      - setting up a distributed environment to collect, analyse and aggregate events coming from production systems to pro-actively monitor production
      - coach the development team and evolve the continuous delivery infrastructure
      - provide external, objective advice on technology choices & changes that affect business, support and operations
      - selecting and interviewing new hires for Kuala Lumpur to set up a remote team.
      - doing myself remote work

      Finally I was asked to advise on the future reference architecture for production applications and to advocate Continuous Delivery.

      - adopting Continuous Delivery,
      - and introducing Scrum as an agile project management methodology.

      The coaching consisted of both defining development guidelines and best practices, defining application architectures, defining deployment and release procedures, automating these procedures, as well as pair programming.

      Facilitating retrospectives and leading continuous improvement.

      Running interviews for recruiting new hires.

      During the mission we introduced at enterprise level the following tooling:

        This project has entirely been designed and implemented by myself; which means I did all the tasks from the communication with the internal customers, requirements gathering through the technical design, implementation, coordination of required developments on third-party applications and deployment coordination as well as reporting upon the project status.

      - Online Watch: a redesign of the web UI for the online watch analysis tool used by customers for analysing their trademark watch requests.
        Together with a team of 4 we redesigned the UI of the application. As a technical leader I assisted the project leader with the technical choices of the project, the implementation and the deployment coordination.
